‚ùå Bad A2 Example:
Original sentence:

Sherlock is such a great character! I love mysteries too! Have you ever looked for clues like Sherlock?

‚ùå Why this is BAD for A2:
"such a great character" ‚Üí
‚ûî "such a" is a strong emphasis structure (like B1+ level). A2 learners avoid "such a..." and just say "very good" or "really nice."

"I love mysteries too" ‚Üí
‚ûî Technically OK, but "mysteries" can feel a little advanced if not explained simply. A2 would more likely say "I like mystery stories" or "I like finding clues."

"Have you ever looked for clues like Sherlock?" ‚Üí
‚ûî Present Perfect ("have you ever") is forbidden at strict A2!
‚ûî A2 students mostly stick to Simple Past ("Did you...") for past experience questions.

‚úÖ Corrected A2 Version:
Simplified sentence:

Sherlock is very cool! I like looking for clues too! Did you look for clues like Sherlock?

‚úÖ Why this is GOOD for A2:
"Sherlock is very cool!" ‚Üí Very simple adjective ("cool"), no complicated structure like "such a."

"I like looking for clues too!" ‚Üí Uses Present Simple + -ing ("looking") ‚Üí good natural A2 level.

"Did you look for clues like Sherlock?" ‚Üí Uses Simple Past ("Did you look...?") ‚Üí correct way to ask about past experiences at A2 level.

‚ûî You can say "Yesterday, I went to the park" using Simple Past.

‚ûî You can say "I saw a big rock yesterday" using Simple Past.

‚ûî You can say "I played hide-and-seek with my friends" using Simple Past.
